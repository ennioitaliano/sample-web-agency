# eTuca-remastered
This is another learning-by-doing project, at a more advanced level than [HTMLPortfolio](https://github.com/ennioitaliano/HTMLPortfolio).

With this one I better learned and applied responsiveness and accessibility, other than lots of other minor improvements to my knowledge of HTML/CSS.
You can try the latest version [here](https://ennioitaliano.github.io/etuca-remastered), if you don't want to clone the repo and experiment by yourself.

I have now to pause/interrupt this project because I received my first website request, in which I will apply all the concepts I learned in these past weeks and, I hope, I will learn something more about forms and maybe Javascript.
